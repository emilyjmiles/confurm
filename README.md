## About The Project
conFURm is a pet health application that allows a user to view their pets medications and wellness reminders as well as request an appointment for their fur babies. A user can view their dashboard which will show them any important reminders or unpcoming appointments and requests. The user can then click on a pet card and view that pet's profile with a detailed list of medications. A user can then submit a request for an appointment for any pet and, as long as the name on their account is the same as the name submitted on the form, the request will show up pending on their dashboard.

## Project Spec

conFURN is a pet health application built in week 17 of [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/) front-end engineering program. The goals of this [solo project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html) were to:

- Utilize React and React Router
- Test the UI/UX using Cypress
- Utilize Lighthouse and Wave for accessibility
- Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
- Implement error handling

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Demo video coming soon!

Future Iterations:

- [ ] Make mobile accessible
- [ ] Create a user login
- [ ] Build out a more robust backend to utilize several users and their pets and provide more medical data for each pet
- [ ] Allow users to also request medication refills
- [ ] Add a veterinary portal login for veterinary offices to login and approve appointment and/or medication requests
- [ ] Add links and contacts for emergency veterinary services and poison control services

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Testing

Utilized testing to create a smooth user experience using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

## Reflections
Since I could not find a suitible API for the application I wanted to build. I 

### Wins:
- Successfully self-taught and built a multiple endpoint Express backend.
- Deepened my understanding of asynchronous javascript.
- Created an application that blended my knowledge of veterinary medicine and my love of animals

### Challenges:
- Building an Express backend.
- Deciphering and understand the best way to compile data for asynchronous requests.
